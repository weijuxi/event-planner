# Event Planner

![Event Planner Screenshot](image.png)

## Description
Event Planner is a web application designed to help users create, manage, and track events. Users can sign up and log in to manage their event lists, add new events, edit existing ones, or delete events no longer needed. Events are categorized by status (e.g., In progress, Completed, Cancelled) for easy tracking.

I built this app to provide a simple, intuitive tool for personal event management, allowing users to keep their schedules organized and ensure nothing gets overlooked.

## Getting Started
### Use the App

### Instructions
1. **Sign up or Log in** to start managing your events.
2. **Add New Events** by filling in details such as title, date, description, and status.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Main logic and interaction on both client and server-side.

## Next Steps
Here are some future enhancements I plan to implement:
